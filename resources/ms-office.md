   #### Notes
      * Microsoft dialog alerts are recorded as events in OAlerts. evtx
      * File access, modification, and deletes may be recorded 
      * Unauthorized access/ permissions issues trigger events
      * Outlook activity is particularly valuable as little other logging exists
      * OAlerts is not a comprehensive source of all Office activity
